# Skin Care "*

HTML code provides a basic structure for a web page presenting skin care information.

In the <head> section of the code, metatags for content type, charset, and Internet Explorer compatibility are defined. The CSS style sheets that will be applied to the page, as well as the page title, are also defined.

The <body> section of the code contains the main content of the page, which includes a header with a logo and a navigation menu, and main content divided into sections.

The main section starts with an image and an orange square that contains an introduction and a call-to-action button. The main section also includes an image of a woman's face and a text that describes the different care that can be provided to the skin.

The skin care section provides information on some homemade products that can be used to care for the skin, as well as some important notes to keep in mind when using these products.

In general, HTML code provides a basic structure for the web page, but does not include the actual content of the page, such as images or detailed text about skin care products.
